# WarGame
This is our first game that we made, so please understand that our future games will be more innovative and creative as time goes on.

EDSSCodingGang is happy to introduce you to our amazing and fantastic coders that are involved in this world-changing and innovative new game, "WarGame". We are creating this game to add entertainment and innovation to our world today. Video Games in general can also: provide a fun and social form of entertainment, encourage teamwork and cooperation when played with others, make kids feel comfortable with technology—particularly important for girls, who don’t use technology as much as boys, increase children’s self-confidence and self-esteem as they master games, provide points of common interest and opportunities for socialization, develop skills in reading, math, technology and problem-solving, encourage participation in related offline activities, such as reading or sports, encourage civic participation, and improve hand-eye co-ordination and fine motor skills. EDSSCodingGang promotes the use of viedo games in our society, as we beleive that it is the way of the future. Our creative video game, "WarGame" will hopefully create that soceity that we hope for in today's world. We hope that you enjoy playing our game, and now, a list of the creators.
